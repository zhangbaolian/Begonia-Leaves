# IMPASSABLE TERRAIN
#####################
# Can be colored by whoever owns the most of the province's neighbours.
# Blocks unit movement.

############
# WASTELAND
############
# These are actually supposed to be Wasteland:
# Cannot be colored. Blocks unit movement, used for things like Sahara desert. 

# IMPASSABLE SEA ZONES
# These sea provinces cannot be crossed/sailed

# UNUSED PROVINCES
# These provinces cause issues because they are passable land, but not part of any title.
# They are probably not visible anywhere on the map, so feel free to reuse them (after double checking that they are actually missing).
